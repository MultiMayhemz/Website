 <p> There once was a child, I mean there's, children everywhere, but there was a special one. His name was me. Harshit. And he had a<br><br> family.
   And he's about to tell you about them. So let's go! There was my dad, Ganesh Timsina (46), and my mom, Vandana<br><br> Upadhyay (39), and they had me!
   My dad had like uncountable brothers and sisters, so I'm gonna tell you about the ones I remember<br><br> about. There was his little brother,
   Pashupati, my uncle (40, I think)! He's a software developer that's teaching me and other kids<br><br> about programming! In fact, he's the one who gave
   us this assignment. He has 2 children, Irya and Krish, my closest cousins. There<br><br> was my dads little sister, Durga. I don't know much about her, sooooo. Moving on! He had 2 older brothers,
   and probably more, but<br><br> these 2 were Muktinath Timsina and Som Dai. I don't know if is name is like Som Timsina, but we just call him
   Som Dai. My dad's<br><br> eldest sister is Parmilla, and she lives in Australia, she's much older than my dad, so her son is my cousin even though
   he's 30 years<br><br> older than me. My dad's parents (my grandparents) are Ama, I don't know her real name, and Ba, I think his real name is Umakanta.<br><br>
   Then there's my mom's side. She has 4 brothers and sisters. 1 brothers, and 3 sisters. Her brothers name is Pradyumna Upadhyay,<br><br> who is 45,
   and has 2 children. Her youngest oldest sister is Shantu Adhikari and she also has 2 children, and she's 41. Her 2nd<br><br> youngest/oldest oldest sister is
   Binita. She's 43 and has 3 children. Her oldest sister is (insert name here since I forgot) and she's 47<br><br> with 2 or more children.
   Their ages go in a +2 years pattern, first my mom, 39, her sister, 41, her other sister, 43, her brother, 45, her<br><br> other other sister, 47.
   Her parents are Niranjan Upadhyay and Usha Devi Upadhyay, both around 70. And then the most special of all, my little brother <br><br>Rehaan!!!
