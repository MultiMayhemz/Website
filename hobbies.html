<p style = "color: blue; text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px dodgerblue;"> Why hello there, today I'm going to tell you the story thats not really
a story of my hobbies.<br><br> I have a fairly decent amount of hobbies. Since I was little, I was always fond of Math. I like to do Math on certain
occasions, but its not really a quote on quote <q>hobby hobby</q>,<br><br> like, I don't do Math in my spare time, just no. There are some boring
hobbies I do like biking every day for like 5 miles, but<br><br> I'm cool so I'll say cool stuff (that was cool talk btw). Ok, onwards we go, I play
soccer. I'm not really like a forward or a midfielder<br><br> (oh god no), plus I suck at defense, but I'm actually pretty good at being a goalie,
which is actually technically defense, except I don't<br><br> suck at it. I have good feet, but I can't aim. More hobbies coming at ya, pew, I watch
YouTube a lot, pew, Netflix, I talk to my friends<br><br> a lot and play minecraft. Dang, I'm all out of bullets, peace! </p>
